## Quick start

Get it from npm

```
$ npm install --save react-plx
```

Import and use it in your React app.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Plx from 'react-plx';

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Plx
        className='MyAwesomeParallax'
        parallaxData={ ... } // your parallax effects, see beneath
      >
        /* Your content */
      </Plx>
    );
  }
}
```

## What is this?

This is React component which makes creating on scroll effects (aka parallax) easy. If you are not sure what it does, [demo](https://stanko.github.io/react-plx/) should help.

It is lightweight, and beside `react`, `react-dom` and `prop-types` ~~has no dependencies~~, now it has small `bezier-easing` package. As listening to scroll event is not performant, this component uses different approach. Interval is set (every 16ms to get 60fps) to check if scroll position is changed, and if it is, it broadcasts custom event. All of the `Plx` components are sharing the scroll manager singleton. Interval is set when the first component is created, and cleared when last one is unmounted. Interval time can be changed through the props, but it is shared across the components.

Elements outside of viewport are not animated. This is done by using `getBoundingClientRect`, but there is a [known bug in iOS](https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6668472289329152) with `getBoundingClientRect` and position `fixed`. If you get into the same problems, you can force rendering by passing `animateWhenNotInViewport={ true }`.

Still you need to avoid common "don't dos" when making a parallax page:

* Avoid `background-size: cover`
* Donâ€™t animate massive images or dramatically resize them
* Avoid animating 100 things at once
* Only use properties that are cheap for browsers to animate - opacity and transform (translate, rotate, skew, scale)

Read this [great article](https://medium.com/@dhg/parallax-done-right-82ced812e61c) to find out more (that is where I got my initial inspiration).

Of course, you can break any of these rules, but test for performance to see if it works for you.

Component is written as ES module, so it will work with webpack and other module bundlers (which is standard for React apps anyway). Tested with `react-create-app` and my boilerplate, [Marvin](https://github.com/workco/marvin).

Read more about how it works in [this blog post](https://stanko.github.io/plx-react-parallax-component/).

## Props

* **className** string

  CSS class name (it will be applied along with `Plx` class name).

* **style** object

  CSS style object, please note that properties used in parallax will be overridden by component.

* **tagName** string, default `div`

  HTML tag to be used for wrapper element.

* **animateWhenNotInViewport** bool, default `false`

  If set to true element will be animated even when it is not in the viewport.
  This is helpful with fixed elements in iOS due to [know bug with `getBoundingClientRect` in iOS](https://openradar.appspot.com/radar?id=6668472289329152).

* **disabled** boolean

  When `true` disabled animation completely.

* **freeze** bool, default `false`

  When `true` animation will be stopped at current state when condition is met.

* **parallaxData** array of items (item structure described beneath), *required*

  Main data, describes parallax segments.

Any other props will be passed to the component (for example this is useful for `aria-*` props).

### parallaxData

* **start** number, string, [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement), *required*

  Scroll position where parallax effect should start.
  Can one of the following:

  * Number - value in pixels
  * String
    * Value in px, vh or % (`50px`, `50%`, `25vh`). Percentage is calculated out of max page scroll.
    * CSS Selector (`.my-element`, `#some-id`) to be used with `document.querySelector`.
    * `"self"` component's element will be used
  * `HTMLElement`, given element will be used.

  For element, selector and "self" animation will start when that element *enters* the viewport. You can use `startOffset` prop to offset start position.

  Example:
  ```js
  start: 100 // starts when scroll hits 100px
  start: 'self' // starts when plx's element enters the viewport
  start: '.start-element' // starts when .start-element enters the viewport
  ```

  **PLEASE NOTE** that `parallaxData` should be sorted by `start` value!

* **end** number, string, [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)

  Scroll position where parallax effect should end.
  It has higher priority than `duration`.
  Can one of the following:

  * Number - value in pixels
  * String
    * Value in px, vh or % (`50px`, `50%`, `25vh`). Percentage is calculated out of max page scroll.
    * CSS Selector (`.my-element`, `#some-id`) to be used with `document.querySelector`.
    * `"self"` component's element will be used
  * `HTMLElement`, given element will be used.

  For element, selector and "self" animation will end when that element *enters* the viewport. You can use `endOffset` prop to offset end position.

  Example:
  ```js
  end: 300 // ends when scroll hits 300px
  end: 'self' // ends when plx's element enters the viewport
  end: '.end-element' // ends when .end-element enters the viewport
  ```

* **duration** number, string, [HTMLElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement)

  How long should effect last (it will finish
  when scroll position equals `start` + `duration`).
  It will be used if `end` is not defined.
  Can one of the following:

  * Number - value in pixels
  * String
    * Value in px, vh or % (`50px`, `50%`, `25vh`). Percentage is calculated out of max page scroll.
    * CSS Selector (`.my-element`, `#some-id`) to be used with `document.querySelector`.
  * `HTMLElement`, given element will be used.

  For element and selecto  animation will start when that element *enters* the viewport. You can use `startOffset` prop to offset start.

  Any other string will be considered CSS selector
  and it will be used with `document.querySelector`.
  Animation will stop when animated element hits top
  of the element passed as duration prop.

  Example:
  ```js
  duration: 300 // animation will last for 300px
  duration: '.duration-element' // animation will last for .duration-element's height
  ```

* **startOffset** number, string

  Start offset, can be a number or string value in px, vh or % (`50px`, `50%`, `25vh`).

* **endOffset** number, string

  End offset, can be a number or string value in px, vh or % (`50px`, `50%`, `25vh`).

* **easing** string, function or array, default: 'linear'

  Easing function, you can pass the name (string) to choose one of the built-in functions.
  Built-in easing functions are:

  * ease
  * easeIn
  * easeOut
  * easeInOut
  * easeInSine
  * easeOutSine
  * easeInOutSine
  * easeInQuad
  * easeOutQuad
  * easeInOutQuad
  * easeInCubic
  * easeOutCubic
  * easeInOutCubic
  * easeInQuart
  * easeOutQuart
  * easeInOutQuart
  * easeInQuint
  * easeOutQuint
  * easeInOutQuint
  * easeInExpo
  * easeOutExpo
  * easeInOutExpo
  * easeInCirc
  * easeOutCirc
  * easeInOutCirc

  Cubic beziers are supported, pass an array to it with four points of your custom bezier (you can copy CSS beziers).
  ```js
  easing: [0.25, 0.1, 0.53, 3]
  ```

  You can even pass custom function which accepts one argument, which will be number from 0 to 1.
  ```js
  // Define your custom easing
  const myCustomEasing = (x) => {
    return x * x;
  };

  ...

  // and then pass it to Plx
  easing: myCustomEasing
  ```
* **name** string (without spaces)

  Name used in [animation state CSS classes](#user-content-animation-state-css-classes)

* **properties** array of items (item structure described beneath), *required*

  List of properties to be animated

### properties

* **property** string, *required*

  CSS property to be animated, works only on properties which accept numerical values (e.g. `opacity`, `height`...).
  For `transform` use function names instead (e.g. `translateX`, `scale`, `rotate`...).
  Same goes for filters.

  Supported transform functions are:

  * translateX
  * translateY
  * translateZ
  * skew
  * skewX
  * skewY
  * skewZ
  * rotate
  * rotateX
  * rotateY
  * rotateZ
  * scale
  * scaleX
  * scaleY
  * scaleZ

  Supported colors are:

  * backgroundColor
  * borderBottomColor
  * borderColor
  * borderLeftColor
  * borderRightColor
  * borderTopColor
  * color
  * fill
  * strokeColor

  Supported CSS filters are:

  * blur
  * brightness
  * contrast
  * grayscale
  * hueRotate
  * invert
  * opacityFilter (as it shares the same name as CSS `opacity`)
  * saturate
  * sepia

  To keep you parallax effects performant, I strongly advice not to use anything but opacity and transforms.
  Some filters should be cheap as well, with `blur` being the most expensive out of supported filters.

* **startValue** number (or string for color), *required*

  Start value for the effect. Property will have this value when scroll position equals `parallaxData.start`.
  For colors supported formats are: `#123`, `#001122`, `rgb(0,0,255)` and `rgba(0,0,255,0.5)`.

* **endValue** number (or string for color), *required*

  End value for the effect. Property will have this value when scroll position equals `parallaxData.end`.
  For colors supported formats are: `#123`, `#001122`, `rgb(0,0,255)` and `rgba(0,0,255,0.5)`.

  Between `parallaxData.start` and `parallaxData.end` value will transition relative to scroll position.

* **unit** string

  CSS unit (e.g. `%`, `rem`, `em`...) to be applied to property value. By default component is using pixels and degrees for rotation and skew.

## Example of props

These are the exact props used in [this example](https://codesandbox.io/embed/m7mx5l9z9p).

```js
const exampleParallaxData = [
  {
    start: 0,
    end: 300,
    properties: [
      {
        startValue: 0,
        endValue: 90,
        property: "rotate"
      },
      {
        startValue: 1,
        endValue: 1.5,
        property: "scale"
      },
      {
        startValue: 1,
        endValue: 0.75,
        property: "opacity"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    start: 350,
    duration: 300,
    properties: [
      {
        startValue: "#3cb99c",
        endValue: "rgba(50,50,200,0.8)",
        property: "backgroundColor"
      },
      {
        startValue: 0,
        endValue: 100,
        property: "translateY"
      },
      {
        startValue: 0.75,
        endValue: 1,
        property: "opacity"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    start: 700,
    duration: 1000,
    properties: [
      {
        startValue: 100,
        endValue: 0,
        property: "translateY"
      },
      {
        startValue: 1.5,
        endValue: 2,
        property: "scale"
      },
      {
        startValue: 90,
        endValue: 0,
        property: "rotate"
      },
      // Blur is not performant
      // Used just as an example for CSS filters
      {
        startValue: 0,
        endValue: 20,
        property: "blur"
      }
    ]
  }
];
```

## Animation state CSS classes

Component will also apply CSS classes that match current animation state.
Classes are:

* `Plx--above`
  scroll position is above first start position (animation isn't started yet)

* `Plx--above`
  scroll position is below last end position (animation is finished)

* `Plx--active`
  scroll position is below first start and last end position (animation is in progress, including between states)

* `Plx--in Plx--in-{n}`
  scroll position is in `n`-th segment (`Plx--in-0`, `Plx--in-1`...).
  If `name` prop is passed (see above) it will be used instead of index (`Plx--in-superDuperName`).

* `Plx--between Plx--between-{a}-and-{b}`
  scroll position is between segments `a` and `b` (`Plx--between-0-and-1`, `Plx--between-1-and-2`...)
  If `name` prop is passed (see above) it will be used instead of index (`Plx--between-superDuperName-and-anotherName`).

`active` class is applied along with both `in` and `between` classes.

## Browser support

Modern browsers and IE10+.

IE9 should work if you provide a polyfill for `requestAnimationFrame`. But I'm not supporting IE9.
